Compare the baseline View Lead screenshot with the latest actual View Lead screenshot and generate a visual regression report using the compare-visual-regression.md guidelines.

Strictly ignore trivial differences:

   Minor color or font rendering changes (including anti-aliasing)
   Pixel-level misalignments or shifts less than 3 pixels
   Differences in dynamic content (like names, dates, IDs), unless these changes affect layout, visibility, or usability
   Browser rendering quirks or image compression artifacts

What to focus on and report:

   Missing or Extra UI Elements:

      Pay special attention to the presence or absence of navigation items, menus, and shortcuts in all navigation panels or shortcut menus.
      Clearly call out any such differences.
      Report if any buttons, menus, or sections are present in one screenshot but not the other.

   Layout and Structure:

      Only report clear, user-noticeable layout changes (major alignment issues, sections missing, overlapping or hidden elements).

   Appearance and Style:

      Only report significant color or style changes that impact usability or branding (not subtle shades).

   Accessibility:

      Note any changes that reduce readability, accessibility, or navigability.

For each significant difference, provide output in the following table format:

- UI Area/Element Affected
- Type of Issue   
- Severity 
- Recommendation  

If there are no user-noticeable or business-impacting UI/UX differences, respond only with:
No significant UI/UX differences found. Navigation menus and all key user interface elements are consistent.

Be strict—report only differences that would matter to a real user or business stakeholder.

Do not include or mention differences in dynamic content (such as lead names, phone numbers, or dates) unless they impact layout or readability.

After analyzing and listing the differences in the specified table format:

   - Generate a complete, minimal, and readable HTML file named visual-regression-report.html that contains the results table (or the no-differences message, if appropriate).

   - The HTML should include a styled table with columns:
   "UI Area/Element Affected", "Type of Issue", "Severity", "Recommendation".

   - If there are no significant differences, the HTML should only display:
   "No significant UI/UX differences found. Navigation menus and all key user interface elements are consistent."

Also generate a Node.js script (named, for example, open-report.js) that will:

   - Write the HTML code to visual-regression-report.html

   - Open the report in the default browser on any major OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)

   - The script should be ready to use with a simple node open-report.js command

   - Ensure both the HTML and script are outputted as separate, copy-pasteable code blocks.

   - Do not output any additional commentary—just the HTML and the Node.js script.

Instruction:
- Read the provided Gherkin feature file.
- Identify all required locators for the scenario. If any locator is missing or incorrect, generate or update the corresponding locator file in `/locators`.
- Next, generate or update all required Page Object classes and methods for the described scenario. Ensure Page Objects import the latest locators and follow your current pattern: constructor receives Playwright Page, all locators are private, clear action methods, robust exception handling, and retries.
- For authentication and navigation, always use: `const { leadsPage } = await TestHooks.performCompleteLogin(page);` and navigate to the required section via the returned page objects (e.g., `leadsPage.gotoCreateLead();`).
- Once locators and Page Objects are in place, generate the Playwright TypeScript test under the appropriate folder (based on the tag, e.g., `smoke` then `/tests/smoke`), using only Page Object Model classes for all interactions (never raw selectors).
- Use random, realistic data for dynamic fields using faker through dataGenerator.ts
- Add assertions for each critical verification step in the scenario.
- Save and organize generated code in this order: `/locators` (for new/updated locators), `/pages` (for Page Objects), and `/tests` (for tests based on tag).
- At the end, summarize which files were generated or updated and where to find test run artifacts (report/video/trace).
- On test failure, capture all Playwright exception details, including stack trace, error message, trace, and video.
- Use Playwright MCP Server APIs to fetch test run artifacts for analysis.
- Analyze the trace and source code to automatically diagnose the root cause (e.g., selector issue, timing, missing element).
- Recommend or apply code fixes (e.g., update locators in Page Object, adjust waits, fix test data) where possible.
- Document the diagnosis and applied/recommended fix in the report summary.
- Optionally, re-run the test after fix and update the test result status.

Context:
- You are an enterprise-grade AI assistant for Playwright automation, fully integrated with MCP Server and following modern POM best practices.
- The project contains a robust login utility via `TestHooks.performCompleteLogin(page)`, which must always be used for authentication and landing on the post-login dashboard. The returned object includes `leadsPage` and other relevant pages for further navigation.

Example:
- Reference implementations for login and lead creation use the pattern:
  - `const { leadsPage } = await TestHooks.performCompleteLogin(page);`
  - `await leadsPage.gotoCreateLead();`
  - Interact with the `CreateLeadPage` object for all actions on the Create Lead screen.

Persona:
- Act as a senior SDET or test architect, ensuring best-in-class code quality, maintainability, and standards compliance.

Output:
- Output newly generated or updated locator files under `/locators`.
- Output newly generated or updated Page Object files under `/pages` (TypeScript).
- Output the test script as a TypeScript file under `/tests`, named after the feature/scenario.
- Include clear comments mapping steps to feature file lines for traceability.
- Summarize at the end: updated/created files and locations of Playwright reports/artifacts.

Tone:
- Professional, concise, and standards-driven.
